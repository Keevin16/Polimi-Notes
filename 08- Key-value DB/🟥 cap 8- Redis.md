>**Redis** which is the name for "**REmote DIrectionary Server**" is an advanced [[Key-value database]],  where **keys** can contain **[[data structures]]** such as **strings**, **hashes**, **lists**, **sets**, and **sorted sets**. Supporting a set of atomic operations on these data types.

Redis **could be used** as: 
	**Database**, because it can persist data to the disk
	**Caching layer** because is fast
	**Message broker** 

>**Best fit** for rapidly changing data with a foreseeable (predicable) database size

Good when:
	**Speed** is critical
	**More** than just a **key-value** pairs
	**Dataset** **can fit** in **memory**
	**Dataset** is not **critical**


---
Redis **is not**:
	Replacement for **Relational Database** nor **document-oriented database**
		it may be used **complementary** to a Relational!
	Good to achieve **persistency**
		even though it offers configurable mechanism for **persistency**, this will lead to **increase the latency** and **decrease the throughput**.

NOTE:
	written in **C**
	The **Core element loop** and the **command execution** is single thread, by the way all 
	Every **operation** is **atomic**
	It have O(1) complexity â‡’ take same amount to retrieve 1 MB or 200 TB of data
