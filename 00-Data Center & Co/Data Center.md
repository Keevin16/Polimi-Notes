It's a dedicated **facility** (or a designated space within a facility) used to house an
organizationâ€™s computing resources and associated components. These typically include
- [[Servers]]
- [[Storage Systems]] 
- [[Networking]]
- [[Equipment]]
- [[ Infrastructure needed to power]]

>Remark: The goal of the **Data Center** is to reach all the people interested in one topic, for this reason needs several component to deal with it, **not only server**!

**Key goals**: 
- **High Availability and Redundancy**
	Systems such as uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), backup generators, multiple network links, and redundant cooling to ensure minimal downtime.

- **Environmental Controls**
	Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, along with fire suppression, are used to maintain optimal temperature, humidity, and safety conditions for IT hardware.

- **Physical Security**
	Access control measures (e.g., ID badges, biometric scanners, CCTV) designed to protect against unauthorized entry.

- **Scalability**
	Data centers must accommodate growth over time, either by adding more racks/servers or by planning additional physical space.

---
The **organizations** must decide whether to **build and maintain** their own data center or **rely partly or fully on external providers**. The following sections describe three primary approaches.

There're different type of Data Center, which are:
- [[Enterprise Data center]]
- [[Colocation Data center]]
- [[Third Party Data center]]

---
Beyond physical data centers, organizations can also leverage [[Cloud Computing]] to provision IT resources on demand.
