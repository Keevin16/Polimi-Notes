### Summary of core application
Big data serves for various three type of business and analytical needs:
- **Reports**: Essential for monitoring and tracking business processes, providing historically snapshot
- **Diagnosis**: used to identify and understand underlying issues, delving into the "why"
- **Decisions**: supports informed **decision-making** by providing actionable insights

### Big Data processing modalities
Different data processing align with different use cases and decision making requirements:
#### Interactive Data processing 
- **Characteristic:** **Low-latency** queries on **historical data**.
- **Functionality:** Allows users to specify queries and receive **immediate, custom-designed answers**. It's "interactive" as queries can be modified dynamically to explore different perspectives.
#### Streaming Data processing
- **Characteristic:** Low-latency queries on live, **continuously arriving data**.
- **Functionality:** **Extracts insights** from a **continuous flow** of real-time data.
#### Large-Scale batch Data processing
- **Characteristic:** Sophisticated processing of **huge amounts of historical data** in a batch approach.
- **Functionality:** Typically involves **querying massive datasets** where **immediate real-time** answers are **not the primary requirement**. (This was highlighted as the focus of the course).

The diverse requirements across reporting, diagnosis, and decision-making, coupled with the varied processing modalities (interactive, streaming, batch), highlight a critical need for:

- **Unified Technology:** A new technological paradigm capable of handling interactive, streaming, and batch queries within a single framework.
- **Cost Reduction:** By consolidating technologies, organizations can significantly reduce infrastructure and operational costs associated with managing separate systems.
- **Complexity Reduction:** A unified approach simplifies the overall data architecture and management, leading to reduced operational complexity.

This shift aims to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness in leveraging big data.
