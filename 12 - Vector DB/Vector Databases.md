Vector Databases are used in AI and ML application, them allows a more efficient and semantically rich data retrieval.

They enable AI system to understand **context and similarity** in large dataset, enhancing search and recommendation system.  

**Data is stored in high-dimensional vector representation**, organized by their semantic similarity,allowing for efficient and meaningful data retrieval based on context.

#### Embedding
[[Embedding]] is a **technique** to **transform text, images, or any other data into vectors**.
To achieve it are used **pre-trained** **models** for textual data map words into a multi-dimensional space.

	For this reason in the same vector space is possible to have text, images, videos, ...

#### Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)
![[Pasted image 20250502162711.png]]
- **Hashes similar input** items into the **same buckets** (with high probability)Â 
	similar hash code!

- I apply hash on the query and check in which bucket it belongs 
	then look for similarities in the same bucket

- Is not perfect, other similar objects might be in different buckets or the query could be assigned in non-perfect buckets

#### Queries the Database
For queries the databases there're many ways, it could be **Brute Force** with a time complexity O(n), which is really time expensive.

To deal with this problem one good solution could be the **Navigable Small Worlds**, where each datum on the databases is mapped with the most similar datapoints.

Another data structure to use to looking up for a datum is the **Skip Linked List**
As you go down the layers, more detailed points are added. When a query is made, the algorithm first searches for the nearest neighbor in the top layer. Each subsequent layer contains more nodes than the one above.

	In this example looking up for 11

Combining these two it's possible to talk about [[Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds - HNSW]] with a time complexity O(ln(N))

It's a multi-layer graph structure to quickly find items (vectors) similar to a query
The new points are inserted into the graph in a probabilistic manner 
- Points are inserted randomly in one layer and it is connected to the new point closer at that level.
- It's not guarantee an exact **KNN** but instead is focused on the speed.

### Inverted File with Product Quantization ([[IVFPQ]])
The IVFPQ is a **fast** and **memory-efficient** algorithm for **approximate nearest neighbor** (ANN) **search**.

**Inverted File Index (IVF)**:
Before all the vector space is divided into a number of **coarse clusters** using a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means).

- **Each vector** is assigned to the **nearest cluster** (also called a "cell").
- **When querying**, the **algorithm searches** only **within the most relevant clusters**, **reducing the search space** significantly.

**Product Quantization (PQ)**:
Within each cluster, vectors are **quantized** to compress them using product quantization.

- The vector is split into sub-vectors, and each sub-vector is quantized separately using its own codebook.
- This allows efficient storage and fast distance computations using precomputed tables.
